This function 1 is not accurate if you don't leave it in battery mode say, when you stop at the Cracker Barrell for lunch and to play one of those trangle games with the tees .
It provides immediate alternatives if the route from the online map program was inaccurate or blocked by an obstacle .
I've used other GPS units, as well as GPS built into cars   and to this day NOTHING beats the accuracy of a Garmin GPS .
It got me from point A to point B with 100% accuracy everytime .
It has yet to disappoint, getting me everywhere with 100% accuracy .
